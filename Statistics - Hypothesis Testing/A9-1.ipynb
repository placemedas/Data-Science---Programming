One way to control p-hacking is to decrease the level of significance to $\\alpha/N$ where 'N' is the number of hypothesis tests conducted. Another measure is to control the false discovery rate ($FP/(FP+TP))$ using another significance level $\\beta$. We first find the index $k$ of largest p-value and it should be $<=(i/m)\\beta$ were $m$ is the number of null hypothesis performed. All null hypothesis tests with p-value index $i <= k $ is considered to be statistically significant."
